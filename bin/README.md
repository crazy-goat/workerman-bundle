# Bin Directory

This directory contains development and contribution scripts for this bundle.
It is **not** the Symfony console you use to run the Workerman server.

For the Workerman server commands, use your **application's** `bin/console`
(e.g., `bin/console workerman:server start`).

## Scripts

### `install-git-hook.php`

Installs a pre-push git hook that runs `composer lint` before each push.
The hook is automatically installed by Composer via the `post-install-cmd`
and `post-update-cmd` scripts.

**Manual reinstall:**
```bash
php bin/install-git-hook.php
```

**Remove:**
```bash
rm .git/hooks/pre-push
```

**Skip on push:**
```bash
git push --no-verify
```
